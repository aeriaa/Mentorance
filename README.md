The simplest and fastest way to connect with JavaScript programmers or to become one. 
# Action calls
It's all about `jQuery`. Each user picks its username and automatically, a `$` gets added.
- To start a video `.call()`, just type the `$username` followed by the `.call` command. Ex: `$johndoe.call`.
- To get back to the main chat window while connected with your peer, press `ESC`.
- And to get back to the video call, input `$video`.
- To `quit` Mentorance, call `$quit`.
